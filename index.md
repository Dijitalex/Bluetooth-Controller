# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone  
My first milestone was setting up buttons to not only provide input to an Arduino, but also to perform a basic function, such as lighting up an LED bulb with the press of a button. To get this to work I had created two simple circuits that light up their respective bulbs, with two wires going into ground and two digital pins to complete the circuit. The buttons were also hooked up similarly, with one wire going into ground and the others going into different digital pins. Of course as stated in the video, alligator clips were used so that the button's plug could be compatible with that of the Arduino. From there we are now able to get an input into the Arduino when the buttons are pressed, however there was an issue of this input (which was a number) constantly changing on its own. After doing some tinkering with both the wiring and coding, it was discovered that the issue was due to the establishment of the buttons, in which they were changed from INPUT to INPUT_PULLUP.
